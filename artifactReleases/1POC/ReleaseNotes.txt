Release Notes version 1 POC

For the POC I got the grid drawing out, and I've written it to be dynamic with screen size
The Grid Manager is able to check for collision, and adjust each gird square if it is colliding with the player's range
The player managers their range and their movement and sprite adjustment based on direction

Whether a player is in range will affect whether they can interact with the objects on the screen. The player's range includes the square they stand on...
In addition to the 8 squares surrounding them. To interact with any object on the grid system, the object will need to be on a "green grid square".

For the final build, the grid and the pointers for player's location and range will not be visible. They will all be viewable from debug mode, but...
most of the visual elements and ques are just to aid the rest of my process.
